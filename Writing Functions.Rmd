```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec) #z-score
```

I want a function to compute z-scores

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("Input must have at least three numbers")
  }
  z = (x-mean(x)) / sd(x)
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

Try my function on some other things. These should give errors.

```{r, error=TRUE}
z_scores(3) #sd(3) = NA
z_scores("My name is Shumei") #cannot get the mean of character
z_scores(mtcars) #cannot get the mean of a dataset
z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)) #sequence with 0 and 1
```
